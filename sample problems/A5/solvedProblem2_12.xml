<p>A certain lottery has the following rules: you buy a ticket, choose $numbers different</p>
<p>numbers from 1 to 100, and write them on the ticket. The lottery has a box with</p>
<p>100 balls numbered 1 to 100. $balls (different) balls are chosen. If any of the balls has one of the numbers you have chosen, you win. We will compute the probability of winning.  </p>
<p>It is somewhat easier to compute the probability of the complement</p>
<p>event, that none of the balls matches any of the chosen numbers. </p>
