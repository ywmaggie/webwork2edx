If you need to summarize a probability distribution by a single number, then <br/>
the mean is a reasonable choice -- although often the _median_ is better <br/>
advised (more on this later). But neither the mean nor median captures how<br/>
_spread out_ the distribution is.<br/>
Look at the following two distributions:<br/>
<image src="/static/1.png" width="800" height="400"/><br/>
They both have the same expectation, 100, but one is concentrated near the middle <br/>
while the other is pretty flat. To distinguish between them, we are interested<br/>
not just in the mean \(\mu = \mathbb{E}(X)\), but also in the typical distance from the<br/>
mean, \(\mathbb{E}(|X - \mu|)\). It turns out to be mathematically convenient to work with<br/>
the square instead: the _variance_ of \(X\) is defined to be<br/>
<b><br/>
\( \mbox{var}(X)  \ = \ \mathbb{E}((X - \mu)^2) \ = \ \mathbb{E}((X - E(X))^2) .\)<br/>
</b><br/>
In the above example, which distribution has a higher variance? <formularesponse type="ci" samples="n,i@1,1:10,10#10" answer="$answer1">

In what follows, take \(\mu\) to be \(\mathbb{E}(X)\).<br/>
1\. The variance cannot be negative.<br/>
    Since each individual value \((X - \mu)^2\) is \(\geq 0\) (since its squared), the <br/>
average value \(\mathbb{E}((X - \mu)^2)\) must be \(\geq 0\) as well.<br/>
2\. \(\mbox{var}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mu^2\).<br/>
    This is because,<br/>
<b><br/>
\( <br/>
\mbox{var}(X)   =  \mathbb{E}((X - \mu)^2) \\<br/>
          =  \mathbb{E}(X^2 + \mu^2 - 2\mu X) \\<br/>
          =  \mathbb{E}(X^2) + \mathbb{E}(\mu^2) + \mathbb{E}(-2 \mu X) \ \ \mbox{(linearity)} \\<br/>
          =  \mathbb{E}(X^2) + \mu^2 - 2 \mu \mathbb{E}(X) \\<br/>
          =  \mathbb{E}(X^2) + \mu^2 - 2 \mu^2 \ = \ \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mu^2.<br/>
\<br/>
\)<br/>
</b><br/>
3\. For any random variable \(X\), it must be the case that \(\mathbb{E}(X^2) \geq (\mathbb{E}(X))^2\).<br/>
    This is simply because \(\mbox{var}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - (\mathbb{E}(X))^2 \geq 0\).<br/>
4\. \(\mathbb{E}(|X - \mu|) \leq \sqrt{\mbox{var}(X)}\).<br/>
    If you apply the previous property to the random variable \(|X - \mu|\) instead of \(X\),<br/>
you get \(\mathbb{E}(|X - \mu|^2) \geq (\mathbb{E}(|X - \mu|))^2\). Therefore,<br/>
\(\mathbb{E}(|X - \mu|) \leq \sqrt{\mathbb{E}(|X - \mu|^2)} = \sqrt{\mbox{var}(X)}\). <br/>
The last property tells us that \(\sqrt{\mbox{var}(X)}\) is a good measure of the typical spread of<br/>
\(X\): how far it typically lies from its mean. We call this the _standard deviation_ of <br/>
\(X\).<br/>
