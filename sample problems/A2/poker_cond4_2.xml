<p><b>Suppose you are dealt the same cards as the previous question. What is the probability that you will get a straight given that you have been dealt these two cards, and that the board is "3\(\clubsuit\), Q\(\spadesuit\), K\(\diamondsuit\)"?</b></p>
<p>    With this flop we can make a straight with the set {6,7}, {2,6} or {A,2} on the turn and river.</p>
<p>    - The number of such card pairs, ignoring order, is <numericalresponse answer="$answer1">
