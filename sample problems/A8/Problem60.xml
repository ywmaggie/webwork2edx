An elevator operates in a building with \($floors\) floors. One day, $people people get into the<br/>
elevator, and each of them chooses to go to a floor selected uniformly at random from <br/>
\(1\) to \($floors\). <br/>
1. Fix some particular person \(j\). What is the probability that person \(j\) gets out at the \(i\)th floor, and every other person does not get out on the \(i\)th floor?  <numericalresponse answer="$answer1">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
<br/>
2. What is the probability that for _any_ \(j\), person \(j\) gets out at the \(i\)th floor and every other person does not get out at the \(i\)th floor?  <numericalresponse answer="$answer2">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
<br/>
3. * Let \(X_i\) be \(1\) if exactly one person gets out on floor \(i\), and \(0\) otherwise. What is \(\mathbb{E}(X_i)\)?  <numericalresponse answer="$answer3">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
<br/>
4. What is the expected number of floors in which exactly one person gets out?  <numericalresponse answer="$answer4">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
