On any given day, the probability it will be sunny is \($sunny_num/$sunny_den\), the probability you <br/>
will have a nice dinner is \(1/$dinner_den\), and the probability that you will get to bed<br/>
early is \(1/$early_den\). Assume these three events are independent. <br/>
Denote by \(S(i)\) be the event that the \(i\)'th day is sunny. Similarly, define \(Di,B(i)\) to be the events that that you have a good dinner on day \(i\) and that you go to bed early on day \(i\) respectively.<br/>
On a particular day, what is the probability all three of these independent events will happen together?  <numericalresponse answer="$answer1">

<br/>
<b>Hint:</b> recall that if three events \(A,B,C\) are independent, then \(P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A)P(B)P(C)\).<br/>
What is the expected number of days before all three of them happen together?  <numericalresponse answer="$answer2">

<b>Hint:</b> Consider the techniques used in problem 2.  <br/>
