You can enter natural logarithms as you would imagine: ln(...).  <br/>
Enter \(ln($k)\): <formularesponse type="ci" samples="k@8:10#10" answer="$answer1">

Recall the setting: each cereal box holds one of \(k\) action figures (chosen at random), and<br/>
you want to collect all the figures. What is the expected number of cereal boxes you need<br/>
to buy?<br/>
Suppose you keep buying boxes until you get all the figures. Let \(X_i\) be the number of <br/>
boxes you buy to get from \(i-1\) distinct figures to \(i\) distinct figures. Therefore<br/>
\(X = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_k\), and of course \(X_1 = 1\).<br/>
What is \(\mathbb{E}(X_i)\)? Well, you already have \(i-1\) of the figures, so the chance of getting<br/>
a new figure in a cereal box is \((k-(i-1))/k\). Call this \(p\). Therefore, the expected amount <br/>
of time you have to wait to get a new figure is \(1/p\): just like waiting for a coin with<br/>
bias \(p\) to turn up heads. That is,<br/>
<b><br/>
\( \mathbb{E}(X_i) \ = \ \frac{k}{k-i+1} .\)<br/>
</b><br/>
Invoking linearity of expectation,<br/>
<b><br/>
\( \begin{eqnarray<b>}<br/>
\mathbb{E}(X)  =  \mathbb{E}(X_1) + \cdots + \mathbb{E}(X_k) \\<br/>
       =  \frac{k}{k} + \frac{k}{k-1} + \frac{k}{k-2} + \cdots + \frac{k}{1} \\<br/>
       =  k \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{k} \right) \\<br/>
       \approx  k \ln k.<br/>
\end{eqnarray</b>} \)<br/>

This confirms our earlier observations about the coupon collector problem: you need<br/>
to buy about \(k \ln k\) boxes.<br/>
After collecting 3 action figures out of $k:<br/>
1. What is the probability your next cereal box will contain a new action figure? <formularesponse type="ci" samples="k@8:10#10" answer="$answer2">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.00001"/>
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </formularesponse>
<br/>
2. In expectation, how many more cereal boxes would you need to collect to get the next action figure?  <formularesponse type="ci" samples="k@8:10#10" answer="$answer3">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.00001"/>
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </formularesponse>
<br/>
What is the expected number of cereal boxes you would have to collect (starting without any action figures) to collect every action figure?  <formularesponse type="ci" samples="k@8:10#10" answer="$answer4">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.00001"/>
                    <formulaequationinput />
