A simple random sample of 100 ights for United Airlines and a simple random sample of 100 ights for American Airlines was obtained. Let \(p_1\) be the true proportion of all<br/>
ights that are on time for United Airlines and let \(p_2\) be the true proportion of all ights<br/>
that are on time for American Airlines. Let \(\hat{p_1}\) and \(\hat{p_2}\) be the sample proportions of on time ights for United<br/>
Airlines and American Airlines, respectively. Based on the sample proportions, the 90% condence interval for<br/>
the difference in the on-time rates for the two airlines, \(p_1  p_2\), was calculated to be<br/>
(0.259, 0.055).<br/>
---<br/>
Based on the 90% condence interval given above, answer each of<br/>
the following questions with _true_, _false_, or _can't tell_.<br/>
1. The true difference in the on-time rate for the two airlines lies in the<br/>
90% condence interval (0.259, 0.055).<stringresponse answer="can't tell" type="ci" >
  <textline  size="20"/>
</stringresponse>
</p><p><br/>
2.  The probability that \(\hat{p_1}  \hat{p_2}\) lies in<br/>
the 90% condence interval (0.259, 0.055) is 1.<stringresponse answer="true" type="ci" >
  <textline  size="20"/>
</stringresponse>
</p><p><br/>
3. The probability that the true difference in the on-time rate for the two<br/>
airlines lies in the 90% condence interval (0.259, 0.055) is equal to 0.90.<stringresponse answer="false" type="ci" >
