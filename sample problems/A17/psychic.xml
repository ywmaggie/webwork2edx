A noted psychic was tested for extrasensory perception. The psychic was presented<br/>
with 200 cards face down and asked to determine if the card were one of five symbols.<br/>
The psychic was correct in 50 cases. Let p represent the probability that the psychic<br/>
correctly identifies the symbol on the card in a random trial. Assume the 200 trials<br/>
can be treated as a simple random sample.<br/>
Suppose you wished to see if there were evidence that the psychic is<br/>
doing better than just guessing. To do this, you test the hypotheses \(H_0 : p = .20\)<br/>
versus \(H_{alternative} : p &gt; .20\).<br/>
