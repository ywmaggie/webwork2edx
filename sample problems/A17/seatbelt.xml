We want to prove that seat-belts save a significant number of lives. In other words, we want to see if we can reject the null hypothesis that seat-belts do not help.<br/>
Suppose first that we know that, in general, the probability of a fatality<br/>
in a car accident is \(q=1%\).<br/>
We examine \(n=1000\) randomly selected records of accidents where the driver<br/>
wore a seat velt. We find that \(k=7\) of these accidents were fatal.<br/>
With what confidence can we conclude that claim is<br/>
correct?<br/>
---<br/>
\(X_i\) = \(i^{th}\) accident was fatal.<br/>
The null hypothesis is that seat belts make no difference. <br/>
\(Pr(X_i=1)=q=0.01\). Alternative hypothesis, \(Pr(X_i=1)&lt;q\).<br/>
The total number of fatal accident under the null hypothesis \(S=\sum_i X_i\).<br/>

\(k=7\) is approximately one standard deviation smaller than the mean, in other words, the \(z\)-score is roughly -1. Using this approximation, the <b>\(p\)-value</b> associated with \(k=7\) is \(\Phi(-1) = Q(1) = \)<formularesponse type="ci" samples="z,n@0,0:100,10000#10" answer="$answer4">

Is this \(p\)-value small enough? Probably not, but what is small enough?<br/>
---<br/>
Suppose that an important decision needs to be made, for example, to<br/>
increase the fine for not wearing a seat-belt. We need to choose<br/>
a <b>significance level</b> \(\alpha\). And this choice has to be made before<br/>
looking at the data. It should <b>NOT</b> be a random variable.<br/>
If \(p \leq \alpha\) we say that the test rejected the null hypothesis<br/>
If \(p &gt; \alpha\) we say that the test failed to reject the null<br/>
hypothesis.<br/>
If we chose \(\alpha=0.2\), should we reject the null hypothesis (answer "yes" or "no")?<stringresponse answer="yes" type="ci" >

If we chose \(\alpha=0.05\), should we reject the null hypothesis ? <stringresponse answer="no" type="ci" >
  <textline  size="20"/>
</stringresponse>
</p><p><br/>
If we have chosen \(\alpha=0.05\), we did not show that seat-belts save lives. <br/>
It is tempting to say that we gained evidence that seat-belts do <b>not</b> save lives. However, that is incorrect. A test cannot provide evidence towards the null hypothesis. We did not disprove that belts save lives.<br/>
