Here's a variant on the balls and bins setup. As usual, you have before you a <br/>
row of \(n\) bins, along with a collection of \(n\) identical balls. But now, <br/>
when throwing each ball, _you pick two bins at random and you put the<br/>
ball in whichever of them is less full_.<br/>
It turns out, using an analysis that is too complicated to get into here, that<br/>
under this small change, the maximum bin size will be just \(O(\log \log n)\) <br/>
instead of \(O(\log n)\).<br/>
This inspires an alternative hashing scheme:<br/>
1\. Pick _two_ completely random functions \(h_1, h_2: \U \rightarrow \{1,2,\ldots, n\}\). <br/>
2\. Create a table \(T\) of size \(n\), each of whose entries is a pointer to a <br/>
linked list, initialized to null. <br/>
3\. For each \(x_i\), store it in either the linked list at \(Th_1(x_i)\) or \(Th_2(x_i)\),<br/>
whichever is shorter.<br/>
4\. Given a query \(q\), look through _both_ the linked list at \(Th_1(q)\) and<br/>
at \(Th_2(q)\) to see if it's there.<br/>
The storage requirement is still \(O(n)\), the average query time is still \(O(1)\), but now<br/>
the worst case query time drops to \(O(\log \log n)\).<br/>
---<br/>
What is the worst case query time for \(n = 2^{64}\) ? O(<formularesponse type="ci" samples="n@1:100#10" answer="$answer1">
