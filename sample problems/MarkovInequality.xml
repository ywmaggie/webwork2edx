<p>Markov's inequality relate probabilities to expectations, and provide bounds for the cumulative distribution function of a random variable.</p>
<p>The Markov's inequality is stated as follow:</p>
<p>If X is any nonnegative random variable and a &gt; 0, then  \(\mathbb{P}(X \geq a) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}(X)}{a}\)</p>

<p>John has a biased coin with \(P(\mathrm{heads}) = $r\). </p>
<p>He tosses this coin \(N\) times and, out of the \(N\) times, </p>
<p>the coin lands on heads $k times. </p>
<p>Using Markov's inequality that he learned from CSE103, </p>
<p>he says that the probabality of seeing at least this many </p>
<p>heads is at most $p. </p>
<p>o How many times did he toss the coin? <br/>\(N\) = <numericalresponse answer="$answer1">
