A scientist discovers a fossil fragment that he believes is either some kind<br/>
of tiger (with probability \(1/3\)) or mammoth (with probability \(2/3\)). To shed<br/>
further light on this question, he conducts a test which has the property that<br/>
for tigers, it will come out positive with probability \(5/6\) whereas for mammoths<br/>
it will come out positive with probability just \(1/3\). Suppose the test comes <br/>
out negative. What is the probability, given the outcome of the test, that the <br/>
fossil comes from a tiger?<br/>
---<br/>
What the question asks is the probability \(\textbf{Pr}(\text{tiger} \ | \ \text{negative})\). Using Bayes rule, we convert it into a joint probability:<br/>
\(\textbf{Pr}(\text{tiger} \ | \ \text{negative}) = \frac{\textbf{Pr}(\text{tiger},\text{negative})}{\textbf{Pr}(\text{negative})}\)<br/>
Split the probability of negative outcome into two cases: outcome negative and the fossil is a tiger <b>OR</b> outcome negative and the fossil is a mammoth.<br/>
\(\textbf{Pr}(\text{negative})  = \textbf{Pr}(\text{tiger},\text{negative}) +  \textbf{Pr}(\text{mammoth},\text{negative})\)<br/>
Then write each joint probability using conditional probabilities that are known. Such conditional probabilities often have an intuitive causal meanings.<br/>
\(<br/>
\textbf{Pr}(\text{tiger},\text{negative}) = \textbf{Pr}(\text{negative} \ | \ \text{tiger}) \textbf{Pr}(\text{tiger})<br/>
\)<br/>
\(<br/>
\textbf{Pr}(\text{mammoth},\text{negative}) = \textbf{Pr}(\text{negative} \ | \ \text{mammoth}) \textbf{Pr}(\text{mammoth})<br/>
\)<br/>
Now we can write the conditional probability \(\textbf{Pr}(\text{tiger} \ | \ \text{negative})\) in terms of probabilities that we know.<br/>
The answer is \(\textbf{Pr}(\text{tiger} \ | \ \text{negative}) =\) <formularesponse type="ci" samples="n,m@1,1:20,20#10" answer="$answer1">
