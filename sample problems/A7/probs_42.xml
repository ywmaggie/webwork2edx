A particular car manufacturer has three factories \(F_1\), \(F_2\), \(F_3\) making 25\, 35\, <br/>
and 40\, respectively, of its cars. Of their output, 5\, 4\, and 2\, respectively, are <br/>
defective. A car is chosen at random from the manufacturer's supply.<br/>
---<br/>
\(1.\) What is the probability that the car is defective? <formularesponse type="ci" samples="n@1:10#10" answer="$answer1">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.00001"/>
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </formularesponse>
<br/>
The event that the car is defective can be split into three disjoint cases:<br/>
being defective and made by each of the three factories. <br/>
Using the law of total probability, we can write this as:<br/>
\(\begin{align<b>}<br/>
\textbf{Pr}(\text{defective})  = \textbf{Pr}(\text{defective}, F_1) + \textbf{Pr}(\text{defective}, F_2) + \textbf{Pr}(\text{defective}, F_3)\\<br/>
 = \textbf{Pr}(\text{defective}|F_1) \textbf{Pr}(F_1) + \textbf{Pr}(\text{defective}|F_2)\textbf{Pr}(F_2) + \textbf{Pr}(\text{defective}|F_3)\textbf{Pr}(F_3) \\<br/>
\<br/>
\)<br/>
---<br/>
\(2.\) Given that the car is defective, what is the probability that it came from factory \(F_1\)?<formularesponse type="ci" samples="n@1:10#10" answer="$answer2">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.00001"/>
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </formularesponse>
<br/>
The description literally tells us what probability we should solve for: \(\textbf{Pr}(F_1|\text{defective})\). <br/>
Using Bayes rule, convert this conditional probability into a joint probability:<br/>
\(\textbf{Pr}(F_1|\text{defective}) = \frac{\textbf{Pr}(F_1, \text{defective})}{\textbf{Pr}(\text{defective})}<br/>
\)<br/>
Again using Bayes rule, convert the joint probability into conditional probability that are known.<br/>
\(\textbf{Pr}(F_1, \text{defective}) = \frac{\textbf{Pr}(\text{defective}|F_1) \textbf{Pr}(F_1)}{\textbf{Pr}(\text{defective})}\)<br/>
---<br/>
<b>Notice</b> that by applying Bayes rule twice, we reverse the condition, and we are able to write \(\textbf{Pr}(F_1 | \text{defective})\) in terms of \(\textbf{Pr}(\text{defective} | F_1)\) along with some scaling factors. This, is an instance of one of the most important formulae in Bayesian statistics: \(\textbf{Pr}(A|B) = \frac{\textbf{Pr}(B|A)\textbf{Pr}(A)}{\textbf{Pr}(B)}.\)<br/>
