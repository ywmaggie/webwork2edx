One coin in a collection of 65 coins has two heads the rest of the coins are<br/>
fair. If a coin, chosen at random from the lot and then tossed, turns up heads<br/>
six times in a row, what is the probability that it is the two-headed coin? <formularesponse type="ci" samples="n@1:10#10" answer="$answer1">
