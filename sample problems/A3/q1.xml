<p>A poker hand consisting of $nCards cards is dealt from a standard deck of 52 cards.</p>
<p>Find the probability that the hand contains exactly $b face cards (Jack, Queen or King).</p>
<p>First, we know the number of all possible hands of $nCards cards is <numericalresponse answer="$answer1">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
.</p>
<p>Then, we calculate the number of hands that have exactly $b face cards.</p>
<p>	The total number of face cards is 12 (Jack, Queen or King of all four suites). To choose $b from them we have <numericalresponse answer="$answer2">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
 possibilities.</p>
<p>	The other $nCards-$b cards in the hand can be any of the non-face cards. There are a total of 52 - 12 = 40 non-face cards. To choose $nCards-$b form them, there are <numericalresponse answer="$answer3">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
 possibilities.</p>
<p>	Thus we can compute the number of hands that have exactly $b face cards, which is <numericalresponse answer="$answer4">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
.</p>
<p>Finally we can calculate the probability of such hands, by calculating the ratio of the number of such hands to the number of all hands. This is <numericalresponse answer="$answer5">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
