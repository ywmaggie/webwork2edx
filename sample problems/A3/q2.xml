<p>A poker hand consisting of $nCards cards is dealt from a standard deck of 52 cards.</p>
<p>Find the probability that the hand contains exactly $b cards of the same suite. It is allowed to have any number of cards in other suites.</p>
<p>First, we know the number of all possible hands of $nCards cards is <numericalresponse answer="$answer1">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
</p>
<p>Then, we calculate the number of hands that contain exactly $b cards of the same suite.</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	We first choose which suite the $b cards is. Obviously, there are <numericalresponse answer="$answer2">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
 possibilities.</p>
<p>	The number of possibilities for the ranks of these cards is <numericalresponse answer="$answer3">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
</p>
<p>	The other $nCards-$b cards in the hand can be any cards that has a different suite than the $b cards. There are a total of <numericalresponse answer="$answer4">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
 such cards. To choose $nCards-$b from them, there are <numericalresponse answer="$answer5">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
 possibilities.</p>
<p>	Thus we can compute the number of hands that have exactly $b cards of the same suite, which is <numericalresponse answer="$answer6">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
.</p>
<p>Finally we can calculate the probability of such hands, by calculating th ratio of the number of such hands to the number of all hands. This is <numericalresponse answer="$answer7">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
