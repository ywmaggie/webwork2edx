<p>A poker hand, consisting of $nCards cards, is dealt from a standard deck of 52 cards.</p>
<p>Find the probability that the hand contains exactly $nHearts hearts.</p>
<p>1. First consider the number of all possible hands, which is to choose $nCards from 52 cards, <numericalresponse answer="$answer1">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
 </p>
<p>2. Then we compute the number of possibilities for a hand that contains $nHearts hearts. </p>
<p>	We need to get the number of possible set of ranks of the $nHearts hearts. This is to choose $nHearts from all 13 possible ranks, thus <numericalresponse answer="$answer2">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
</p>
<p>	The other $nOther non-heart cards can be any of the non-heart cards in the deck. The total number of non-heart cards is the total number of cards, minus the heart cards, which is 52 - 13 = 39. Thus the number of possibilities for the $nOther non-heart cards in the hand is <numericalresponse answer="$answer3">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
</p>
<p>	Thus we know that the number of hands that contain exactly $nHearts hearts is <numericalresponse answer="$answer4">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
</p>
<p>3. Finally we can calculate the probability of such hands, by calculating th ratio of the number of such hands to the number of all hands. This is <numericalresponse answer="$answer5">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
</p>
