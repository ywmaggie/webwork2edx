            <b>Like the previous question, suppose you have been dealt "\(4\heartsuit, 5\heartsuit\)".</b>
            <br/>
            <b>What is the conditional probability that you will get a hand at least as high as a full house, given that you have been dealt these two cards, and that the flop is "\(3\heartsuit, 4\spadesuit, K\diamondsuit\)"?</b>
            Note that ranks that are higher than full house are four-of-a-kind, straight flush and royal flush.

            <p>To make a full house or four of a kind, need to get two cards out of the remaining cards whose ranks are 4 or 5. The number of such card pairs, ignoring order, is </p>
