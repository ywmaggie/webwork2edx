How accurate is a pregnancy test? Here we make up some numbers and compute the relevant conditional probabilities.<br/>
The sample space in this case consists of women who use the test call this \(\Omega\)  There are two events on this space that we care about: \(P = \{\mbox{actually pregnant}\}\) and \(T = \{\mbox{test says pregnant}\}\)  <br/>
Suppose that the following are determined (warning: these are fabricated!):<br/>
\( T \subset P, \ \ \ P(P) = 0.4, \ \ \ P(T) = 0.3 .\)<br/>
There are two conditional probabilities we'd like to compute.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, since \(T \subset P\)  we have \(P(P|T) = 1.0\)  Algebraically, \(P(P \cap T) = P(T)\)  so \(P(P|T) = P(P \cap T)/P(T) =\) <formularesponse type="ci" samples="n,m@1,1:20,20#10" answer="$answer1">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.00001"/>
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </formularesponse>
 <br/>

Let \(T^c = \Omega - T\) be the event that the test is negative. Then \(P(T^c) = 1 - P(T) = 0.7\) and \(P(P \cap T^c) = P(P) - P(P \cap T) = \) <formularesponse type="ci" samples="n,m@1,1:20,20#10" answer="$answer2">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.00001"/>
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </formularesponse>
  These are the two probabilities we need.<br/>
\( P(P | T^c)  \ = \ \frac{P(P \cap T^c)}{P(T^c)} \ = \ \frac{0.1}{0.7} \ \approx \ 0.14 .\)<br/>
What is \(P(P|T)P(T)\)? <formularesponse type="ci" samples="n,m@1,1:20,20#10" answer="$answer3">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.00001"/>
