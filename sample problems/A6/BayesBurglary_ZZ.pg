## Bayes' Burglary ##
The following example is taken from _Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems_ by Judea Pearl:
'''You wake up in the middle of the night to the shrill sound of your burglar alarm. What is the chance that a burglary attempt has taken place?'''
The relevant facts are:
o  There is a [$atpt]% chance that an attempted burglary attempt will trigger the alarm. That is,
[`` P(\mbox{alarm} | \mbox{burglary}) = [$perc] .``]
o  There is a [$fals]% chance of a false alarm.
[`` P(\mbox{alarm} | \mbox{no burglary}) = [$fperc].``]
o  Based on local crime statistics, there is a one-in-10,000 chance that a house will be burglarized on a given night:
[`` P(\mbox{burglary}) = ``] [______]{1/10000}
o  We are interested in the chance of a burglary given that the alarm has sounded. We can use the conditional probability formula for this:
[`` P(\mbox{burglary} | \mbox{alarm}) 
\ = \ \frac{P(\mbox{burglary, alarm})}{P(\mbox{alarm})}
\ = \ \frac{P(\mbox{alarm} | \mbox{burglary}) P(\mbox{burglary})}{P(\mbox{alarm})}
.``]
o  The one term we don't immediately know is [`P(\mbox{alarm})`].  By the summation rule,
[`` 
P(\mbox{alarm}) 
\ = \ 
P(\mbox{alarm} | \mbox{burglary}) P(\mbox{burglary}) +
P(\mbox{alarm} | \mbox{no burglary}) P(\mbox{no burglary})
.``]
o  What is [`P(\mbox{alarm})`]?  [_____]{Compute("$perc*0.0001+ $fperc*0.9999")}
o  What is [`P(\mbox{burglary}, \mbox{alarm})*100`]?  [_____]{Compute("$perc*0.0001*100")}
o  Putting it all together, using the conditional probability definition mentioned above:
[`` P(\mbox{burglary} | \mbox{alarm}) = ``]
[_______________________]{$sol}

Thus our belief in a burglary has risen approximately a hundredfold from its default value of [`10^{-4}`]  on account of the alarm.

It is frequently the case, as in this example, that we wish to update the chances of an event [`H`] based on new evidence [`E`]  In other words, we wish to know [`P(H | E)`]  
o  The derivation above implicitly uses the following formula, called Bayes Rule:
[`` P(H | E) 
\ = \ 
\frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}.
``]
