As another example, let's look at the Three Prisoner's Paradox, which is actually just a reformulation of the Monty Hall problem. The story goes that there are three prisoners \(A,B,C\) in a jail, and one of them is to be declared guilty and executed the following morning. As the night progresses, prisoner \(A\) is wracked with worry, and calls the prison guard over. He wants to know whether he is the unlucky one. The guard replies, I am not allowed to tell you whether you will be declared guilty. But I can say that prisoner \(B\) will be declared innocent.'' Prisoner \(A\) thinks about this for a little while and then starts worrying even more. Before he asked the question, it seemed like his chances of dying were one-in-three. But after his innocuous question, the chance seems to have risen to one-in-two!<br/>

Actually, Prisoner \(A\) s chances are still one in three. The two events of interest are:<br/>
\(<br/>
G_A = \{\mbox{$A will be declared guilty} \}<br/>
\)<br/>
\(<br/>
I_B = \{\mbox{the guard, when prompted, will declare $B to be innocent} \}<br/>
\)<br/>
Lacking in any additional information we assume that the probability that A is guilty is \(P(G_A) = 1/3\).<br/>
Consider \(P(I_B | G_A)\), in this case the guard can reveal the innocence of either B or C. Assuming that he is impartial, the probability that he will declare B to be innocent is 1/2.<br/>
Similarly consider \(P(I_B | G_A^c)\). In this case either B or C is guilty and the other is innocent. Again the probability that the innocent one is B is 1/2. In this case the guard has only one option. <br/>
Using the summation rule,<br/>
\( <br/>
P(I_B) <br/>
\ = \ <br/>
P(I_B | G_A) P(G_A) + P(I_B | G_A^c) P(G_A^c) <br/>
\ = \ <br/>
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3}<br/>
\ = \ <br/>
\frac{1}{2}.<br/>
\)<br/>
Therefore, by Bayes' rule,<br/>
\(<br/>
P(G_A | I_B) <br/>
\ = \ <br/>
\frac{P(I_B | G_A) P(G_A)}{P(I_B)}<br/>
\ = \ <br/>
\)<br/>
<formularesponse type="ci" samples="n,m@1,1:20,20#10" answer="$answer3">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.00001"/>
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </formularesponse>
<br/>
Why is the result here different than the one we have in the Monty Hall Problem? There the player could switch the door they chose, here prisoner A cannot exchange his fate with that of another prisoner.<br/>
And, think about it, the guard, who knows the outcome, can *always* point to <br/>
another prisoner that is innocent, regardless of whether A is innocent or not, therefor what the guard is saying does not provide A with any information.<br/>
