BEGIN_PGML
A dartboard is partitioned into [$wedges] wedges of equal size, numbered 1 through [$wedges]. Half 
the wedges are painted red, and the other half are painted black. Suppose [$darts] darts are thrown 
at the board, and land at uniformly random locations on it.
- What is the probability that a particular wedge (say, wedge 1) does not receive a single 
dart? [______]{"(($wedges-1)/$wedges)**($darts)"}

Let [`X_i`] be the number of darts that fall in wedge [`i`]. 
- [`\mathbb{E}(X_i) = `][_____]{"$darts/$wedges"}
- [`\mbox{var}(X_i) = `][_____]{"$darts*$var"}
- For [`S`] a real random variable with standard normal distribution, what is [`P(S < 1.65)`]?  [______]{"Phi(1.65)"}
- Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, give an upper bound on 
[`X_i`] that holds with 95\% confidence.  The answer to the previous question may be helpful here.  Note: you're only considering one tail of the distribution.  [____________________]{"$darts/$wedges + 1.65*sqrt($darts*$var)"}

Let [`Z_r`] be the number of darts that fall on red wedges, let [`Z_b`] be the number of darts 
that fall on black wedges, and let [`Z = |Z_r - Z_b|`] be the absolute value of their 
difference. We would like to get a 99\% confidence interval for [`Z`]. To do this, define

[$BCENTER]*
[`` Y_i \ = \ \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
                     1 & \mbox{if }i^{th}\mbox{ dart falls in red region} \\
                    -1 & \mbox{if }i^{th}\mbox{ dart falls in black region}
                     \end{array} \right.``]
[$ECENTER]*
and notice that [`Z_r - Z_b`] can be written as [`Y_1 + Y_2 + \cdots + Y_{[$darts]}`], the sum of 
independent random variables.
- [`\mathbb{E}(Y_i) = `][_______]{"0"} and [`\mbox{var}(Y_i) = `][______]{"1"}?
- Using the central limit theorem, we can assert that [`Z_0 = Z_r - Z_b`] is approximately
a normal distribution.  [`\mathbb{E}(Z_0) = `][______]{"0"} and [`\mbox{var}(Z_0) = `][_______]{"$darts"}
- Give a 99\% confidence interval for [`Z_0`]:  [`\mathbb{E}(Z_0) \pm`][______]{"2.575*(sqrt($darts))"}  Hint: look back to problem 3.  
- Using this, give a 99% confidence interval for [`Z = |Z_0|`]: [`0 \leq Z \leq `][______]{"2.575*(sqrt($darts))"}
