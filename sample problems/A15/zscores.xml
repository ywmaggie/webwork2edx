<b>Definition:</b> The _z-score_ is the common name for what we called in class the "normalized" value. If a distribution under study has mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\) and the raw value the random variable takes on is \(x\), then the z-score is \(z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\). The mean of \(z\) is zero and the standard deviation is 1. z-scores are often associated with the normal distribution, and z-score tables describe the cumulative distribution function of \(N(0,1)\), usually called \(\Phi(z)\).  The function \(1 - \Phi(z)\) is usually referred to as \(Q(z)\).  Asking for the z-score of some number \(a\) is the same as asking "how many standard deviations is \(a\) above/below the mean?"<br/>
Let \(x\) be the raw value for some normally distributed random variable with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\).  <br/>
