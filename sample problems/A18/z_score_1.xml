You know that on a "normal day", 10% of articles on reddit:technology relate to Apple (I made this up).  You decide to use this fact to decide whether today is a special (not normal) day for Apple.  <br/>
You choose 40 articles at random, and 8 of these articles are about Apple.  How confident are you that today is not a normal day?  <br/>
Let \(p\) be the actual proportion of r/tech articles today that are about Apple.  <br/>
The null hypothesis is H0: \(p = \)<numericalresponse answer="$answer1">
                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />
                    <formulaequationinput />
                </numericalresponse>
</p><p><br/>
The alternative hypothesis is H1: \(p &gt; 0.1\)<br/>
What is the value of the large-sample z-score? <numericalresponse answer="$answer2">

What is the p-value for the test statistic? (You can use Q function in the answer) <numericalresponse answer="$answer3">

</p><p>  Let's say we only are testing whether _more_ Apple-related articles have been linked to than normal.  <br/>
Can you reject at the .05 signicance level? (answer "yes" or "no") <stringresponse answer="yes" type="ci" >
