You have an algorithm A for testing whether a Boolean formula f is satisfiable or not, but it is only correct with probability \($k-1/$k\). More precisely, you can repeatedly run A on the same formula f, and each time it outputs the correct answer with probability \($k-1/$k\).<br/>
To reduce the probability of error, you run A(f) \(n\) times, and return the majority answer. What should \(n\) be if you want the probability of error to be less than 0.05?<br/>
---<br/>
Let \(C_i\) be a binary random variable indicating whether the \(i^{th}\) execution of algorithm A is correct.  Let \(C = (C_1 + C_2 ... C_n)/n\).  <br/>

_Approach 1_:<br/>
Chebyshev's inequality says for random variable \(Y\) with mean \(\mu\) and for any positive number \(a&gt;0\), $P(|Y-\\mu| \\geq a) \\leq var(Y)/a^2<br/>

                    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" />

</p><p> (Give a numerical answer. Use \(Q^{-1}(0.05) = 1.6449\), where \(Q^{-1}\) is the inverse of Q function)<br/>
---<br/>
Notice that \(n\) obtained with Approach 2 is much smaller than that obtained with Approach 1, this is because using the normal approximation and Q function give us a much tighter bound than the Chebyshev bound. (The Q function drops exponentially fast as the value deviates from the mean, while the Chebyshev bound drops only quadratically fast)<br/>
