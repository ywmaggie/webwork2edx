The <b>standard</b> normal distribution \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\) is a special normal distribution with mean \(\mu=0\) and standard deviation \(\sigma=1\). <br/>
- The CDF of the standard normal distribution is denoted \(\Phi\):<br/>
&gt;&gt;\(\Phi(z) = P(Z\leq z)\). &lt;&lt;<br/>
- The complement of the CDF is called the <b>Q-function</b>:<br/>
&gt;&gt;\(Q(z) = P(Z&gt;z) = 1-\Phi(z)\).&lt;&lt;<br/>
While \(\Phi(z)\) measures the probability mass of a "head" of the standard normal, \(Q(z)\) measures the "tail". The values of Q are often tabulated for commonly used \(z\). One such table is _http://goo.gl/Szofn1_. One can also use _http://wolframalpha.com_ to find numeric values for Q function.<br/>
- An alternative representation of the head probability is the <b>error function</b>, denoted \(erf\). It is related to \(\Phi\) by:<br/>
&gt;&gt;\(\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}erf(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}})\)&lt;&lt;<br/>
<b>For this set of assignment, you can use "Phi", "Q" or "erf" as functions in your answer.</b> <br/>

Suppose a monkey is given a test that consists of $n multiple-choice questions each with $nc choices. By random guessing, what is the <b>exact</b> probability that the monkey gets at least $corr correct ?<br/>
<formularesponse type="ci" samples="m,n,i,k,x,y,z@1,1,1,1,1,1,1:10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10#10" answer="$answer1">

We know that the number of questions the monkey guesses correctly follows a binomial distribution, and we have computed the <b>exact</b> probability of a tail of this distribution, by summing up all cases in the tail.<br/>
Now, we assume the number of questions is large enough so that by <b>central limit theorem</b> we can use a normal distribution to approximate the binomial distribution. This makes computing the probability of a certain part of the distribution much easier. <br/>
---<br/>
Again, suppose the monkey is taking a multiple-choice test that consists of $n questions each with $nc possible answers, let us estimate the probability that it gets at least $corr questions correct, this time using an <b>approximated normal distribution</b>. <br/>
Suppose \(X\) is the number of correct answers.<br/>
